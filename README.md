# campuscovidteam

Description
____________
A website to help college students get connected to each other and comply with regulations during COVID-19. Our website has the functionality of allowing users to send anonymous emails to other users from their school, nudging them to better comply with precautions, continue complying as well as they are, or sending them a virtual hug. It also sends users a weekly survey, collecting thoughts on how well their campus is complying, and tracking this data over time.
____________


Inspiration
____________
We were inspired by the way the Joe Biden app uses social connections to encourage citizens to register and go out and vote. We wanted to create a similar platform that used social connections to encourage coronavirus precaution compliance amongst a specific community.
____________


Implementation
____________
We used Canva to create a prototype of the website. We then used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and git to begin to implement the website. We used a name.com domain and connected it to our GitHub pages, rerouting the IP addresses to reconfigure the DNS server.
